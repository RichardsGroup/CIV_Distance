# CIV_Distance
Repo to compute C IV "distances" as advertised in Richards et al. papers.


The code you'll need is in ``CIVfunctions.py``


For a visualization of how C IV "distance" changes throughout the EW-blueshift plane, hover over the points in this plot: http://physics.drexel.edu/~tmccafferey/CIV_distance_example.html
